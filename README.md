# URLShortener-TS
this is a website and a tool to transform your long urls to short urls! for example if you have a url like `https://www.tst.com/tst1/tst2/tst3/tst4` and it is long for you, you can transform that to something like `https://urls-hortener-ashen.vercel.app/a4ggnv` or `https://urls-hortener-ashen.vercel.app/tst`!

# url transforming options
you have two options to transform your short urls
* transform url to a random url
* transform url to a custom url

## transform url to a random url
by transforming your url to a random url, you will get a url with a route that is a word with 6 letters. for example something like this: `https://urls-hortener-ashen.vercel.app/afh4td`

## transform url to a custom url
perhaps you dont like this website to transform your url to a random url with a route that is a word with 6 letters. no problem! you transform your url to a custom short url! for example you can turn `https://www.google.com/search?q=google+seo+analytics&rlz=1C1GCEA_enIR952IR952&oq=goo&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j69i59j35i39j46i199i465i512j69i60l4.2721j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8` to `https://urls-hortener-ashen.vercel.app/g`!
